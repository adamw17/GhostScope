# GhostScope
An hobby OS watchtower to learn kernel dev and reverse engineer

*A personal journey into kernel development, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and system introspection — built in small daily steps.*

GhostScope is a growing toolkit and learning laboratory for:

- Linux kernel modules  
- eBPF tracing  
- ELF / PE binary analysis  
- Reverse engineering  
- Security-minded systems development  

The goal is to build a lightweight system observability and security analysis framework, one small milestone at a time.

# 🎯 Why This Exists

Instead of studying from books, this project is built through:

- Tiny daily experiments  
- Real code  
- Real tools  
- Real debugging  
- Real documentation

This is both:

- A portfolio of systems/security engineering, and  
- A structured self-learning journal for staying motivated over time.

# 🧠 High-Level Vision

GhostScope will eventually (in small steps) allow:

- Watching process behavior from the kernel side  
- Tracing syscalls using eBPF  
- Extracting binary metadata (sections, symbols, imports, entropy, etc.)  
- Logging suspicious behavior  
- Producing small automated analysis reports  

Think of it as:

> A tiny personal EDR + RE toolkit built from scratch.
